The three test classes/cases in this directory are the exact copies of the ones I developed in the JAdventure test framework. I just copied them and pasted here so that it is easier to find for grading.  

The original location of the test classes are:
src/test/java/com/jadventure/game/prompts/CommandCollectionTest.java
src/test/java/com/jadventure/game/monsters/MonsterFactoryTest.java
src/test/java/com/jadventure/game/monsters/MonsterTest.java

Since the tests are already in their original locations mentioned above. By opening this project in Eclipse and running JUnit test will execute the tests I developed. 

The instructions to run this application is given in the original readme of this project. Apache ant will need to be installed.
